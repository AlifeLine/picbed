## About Next branch

Completely refactored v2 version, SPA application with separated front and
back ends, the front end uses Vue.js 2.6 and ElementUI, the back end
uses Python3.6 and JSONRPC as interfaces.

Of course, due to front-end level restrictions and other issues, it cannot
be completed in a moment, and the master branch will undergo repair updates.
